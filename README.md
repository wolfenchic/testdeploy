A paragraph is just a paragraph. You don't need to provide any p tags or breaks.

I used semantic `<section>` tags instead of `<div>`.

```javascript
function multiplication (a,b);
    if(typeof(a) == "number"&& typeof(b) == "number") {
        return a * b;
    } else {
        alert(Error!);
    }
    }
```
